Game Mechanics 

- Player need to collect the sphere that charge his/her jump according to hooke's law that is the more spheres collected more enegry is stored therefore higher jump can be accomplished.


Setup instructions 
- You can add any number of spheres to the scene just make sure that they are refrenced in the game manager
- Change the player setting like its speed or spring force with the help of player settings scriptable object
- Setup the sence in any way you want though I made a simple level to try

Note 
- I was not able to develop the game for mobile as , I was not able to code aiming with mouse .
- I was able to figure out everything else to make it for mobile , like linking button events using event trigger as button are not allowed to have monobehavior due to assignment constraint
